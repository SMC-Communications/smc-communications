Our lead Brand Strategist, Penny has crossed the chasm from client-to-agency side twice in her career. She’s a fan of understanding ‘all the angles’, gathering as much data as she can, to understand the many facets of human behaviour. In her two decades' worth of experience, she has helped several established organizations and start-ups to grow and adapt, from brands in Agriculture\* to Alcohol, CPG to SaaS and premium Health & Wellness.
