  The most remarkable thing about the team at SMC is that they really listen.
  They 'GET' us, and they get our brand, our language, and our philosophy. Their
  contacts within the industry are quite astounding. It was their PR contacts
  that got us through the challenging years of COVID and lockdowns. Their
  marketing campaigns were fun and playful, and their social media management
  was consistently engaging. This is a team that really cares about their
  clients, and I cannot say enough good things about working with them.
