  Passionate, driven and results-oriented, Shelley brings over two decades of
  experience and earned reputation as one of Western Canada's leading
  hospitality public relations professionals. Her proven marketing
  communications strategies have boosted revenues and driven millions of dollars
  worth of true-to-brand editorial exposure that connect her clients to a wider
  audience both in British Columbia and beyond.


  Having founded SMC in 2013, Shelley has worked in partnership with a roster of
  noteworthy clients that represent a virtual who’s who of Vancouver’s vibrant
  culinary scene including Ask For Luigi, St. Lawrence, Chambar, Tacofino,
  Momofuku, White Spot Hospitality, Destination Vancouver, Pattison Food Group
  and Ocean Wise to name a few. Prior to that, Shelley served a six-year tenure
  as Communications Director for the Toptable Group (Whistler’s Araxi and
  Vancouver’s Blue Water Cafe, CinCin, West and Thierry) and with the Rick
  Hansen Foundation, where she was part of the communications team that led its
  Wheels in Motion national fundraising campaign as well as the 15th and 20th
  anniversaries of Hansen’s epic Man in Motion World Tour.


  Shelley’s experience in the not-for-profit sphere gave her the background that
  helped her launch Breaking Bread, a groundbreaking non-profit initiative
  providing support for local, independent restaurants and the foodservice
  industry at large in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout 2020, she
  also sat on the COVID-19 Metro Vancouver Tourism & Hospitality Recovery Task
  Force and two of its sub-committees: Communications and Supply-side Recovery.
  Shelley currently sits on the Advisory Board of W.O.R.T.H. Association - Women
  of Recreation, Tourism & Hospitality - challenging The Gender Pay Gap,
  Discrimination, Work/Life Balance Challenges, Lack of Advancement
  Opportunities and Retention Challenges, serving her industry contemporaries.


  Shelley holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications from Royal Roads
  University, a Public Relations diploma from Kwantlen Polytechnic University,
  and Level II accreditation from the International Sommelier Guild.
