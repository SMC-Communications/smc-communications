Emma brings a natural sense of curiosity to her role supporting our PR accounts and marketing teams. Graduating from BCIT in 2021, Emma started her career in supporting roles for various Business Improvement Associations setting the foundation for her passion in hospitality and tourism. There she honed her skills in event hosting and has since vastly expanded her passion for media relations, taking the lead at SMC in fall 2023 for our W.O.R.T.H. Association clientâ€™s event: Yes Shef.
