  Shelley and her team are absolute pros. I’ve appreciated that as a journalist
  and as well, I like them as they’re smart, witty people. And I was impressed
  by their caring leadership when COVID-19 hit and they quickly spearheaded the
  non-profit Breaking Bread to help Canada's food services industry.
